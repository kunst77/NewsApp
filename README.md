# guardianNewsApp
Android News App from Android Udacity Course

This app was the final project for the Android Basics by Google Nanodegree
course offered through Udacity.

It was built using Android Studio and fetches news stories from theguardian.com

The app allows a user to search by a keyword to fetch a new list of news articles.
